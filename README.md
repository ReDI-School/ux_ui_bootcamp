## The Bootcamp 
ReDI's UX/UI Bootcamp is a part-time (20 hours per week) bootcamp lasting for 18 months. It focuses on UX/UI design and aims to support participants prepare for an Internship in the industry. 

Our learning approach builds on learning by doing. Students work on three hands-on projects throughout the bootcamp. Each project lasts 4 weeks and contains 3 Milestones plus a Bonus Milestone. We aim to be as close as possible to a real work environment where juniors receive deliverables, work on them, run into issues, seek support, and present their solutions to seniors. Students work in peer-to-peer sessions, in small groups with coaches, and in input sessions with experts. However, the majority of the workload is the actual project work where students individually progress their project by working on the weekly milestone. 

## Overview

ReDI's UX/UI Bootcamp curriculum consists of 4 projects spread over 18 weeks. In the following diagram, you'll find the sequence of all the modules included:

## Evaluation
During each project, coaches will individually monitor your work. Students finish one milestone each week. Coaches give feedback and support in the Monday Support Session. However, the milestones are not evaluated. 

Students hand in their projects at the end of each project cycle. The deliverables per milestone are relevant for the evaluation. Remember that the learning objectives are more important than the completeness of your project. 

At the end of your project, you present your work to the coaches and will receive feedback. Before this session, you will need to reflect and self-evaluate against the learning objectives. In this feedback session, you will validate your self-evaluation with your coaches. If some objectives have not been met, the coaches may recommend proceeding to achieve the missing learning objectives, which could involve continuing with the current project (more time) or doing a complementary project. Remember that everyone learns at their own pace, and it is important to gradually acquire the skills associated with the learning objectives. Your coaches and peers are there to support you.


## Final words
Mastering UX & UI design is a challenging journey, but with the right resources and guidance, it's definitely achievable. This curriculum is designed to support your ambition. Feel free to use it to your advantage. If you find any areas for improvement, please let us know or contribute with a pull request. Best of luck on your path, and happy crafting!
