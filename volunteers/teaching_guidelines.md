# Teaching Guidelines

## Teaching Method: I Do, We Do, You Do

The "I Do, We Do, You Do" method is a teaching methdo designed to help students learn new concepts by first observing, then practicing with guidance, and finally working independently. 

- **I Do:** The teacher demonstrates the task while explaining the steps and thought process out loud. This stage is all about modeling the correct way to approach the task, making sure to highlight key concepts and techniques.
- **We Do:** The session owner walks the students through an activity. The students follow along (code or design along). This collaborative stage allows students to apply what they've seen with support, ask questions, and receive immediate feedback.
- **You Do:** Students work independently on the task. This stage allows them to practice the skill on their own.

**Example: Designing a User Flow**

- **I Do:** The teacher explains what a user flow is and why itâ€™s useful in UX design. They show how to create a simple user flow for a login process in Figma, explaining each step like setting the starting point and mapping user actions. Alternatively to showing the User flow in Figma, the teacher can also use the provided slide deck as support.
- **We Do:** Next, the session owner walks the students through creating the starting point of a user flow. For example, for a basic e-commerce checkout process. The teacher asks guiding questions like, "What should the user see after clicking 'Add to Cart'?" or "What decisions does the user make at the payment step?" The class works together to map out the steps, with the teacher providing feedback and making adjustments as needed.
- **You Do:** Finally, students are tasked with creating a user flow for a different scenario, such as booking a ticket on a travel website. They work individually but can refer to the examples and ask for help if needed. After completing their user flows, students share their work for peer feedback and teacher review.


## Tips and Tricks

- **Context before content** - We experienced that explaining why a concept is important helps a lot in understanding what the concept is about. Why should you learn this concept? Try to give the context. Maybe explain where you use it in your daily work life. Or explain how this concept can help to solve a bigger problem
- **Engage with Students:** Ask questions to check understanding. Use their names and keep the tone friendly and encouraging.
- **Be Prepared, but Flexible:** Have a plan but adapt based on student needs.
- **Feedback is Key:** Provide constructive feedback to help students improve. Celebrate small wins to keep motivation high.
