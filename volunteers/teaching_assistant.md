# Teaching Assistant

## Introduction 

As a teaching assistant, you support the session owner in the [Input Session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/input_session.md). You open the Zoom call, track attendance, help answer questions, and provide support in break-out rooms.

## How to run the Input session as the Teaching Assistant

1. Coordinates with the Session Owner before the session
2. Review the slides to be aware of the content to be covered

**In the Session:**

1. Open Zoom call as a host (with host key pinned in Slack channel)
2. Start the recording (it saved then automatically on the Cloud)
3. Moderation support: Keep an eye on live questions & make sure each student is given time to ask a question 
4. Breakouts: support group work/exercises
5. Tracks Attendance (> Camera on policy!)
