# Milestone 2 - Conducting and Analysing User Interviews
 
### What you do:

You will recruit participants, conduct 3-5 user interviews, transcribe and code the data, and identify key themes and insights. This involves preparing interview scripts, obtaining consent from participants, and using various tools and techniques to analyze the data collected. You will look for patterns and themes that reveal user behaviors, attitudes, needs, and pain points.

### What you learn:

You will develop skills in qualitative research, including conducting interviews and analyzing qualitative data. Through data transcription and coding, you will gain experience in identifying and categorising key themes and insights, which are essential for understanding user needs and behaviors.

### Tips:

- Prepare thoroughly for interviews by creating a detailed script and obtaining all necessary consent forms.
- Use a tool that allows you to record the audio call or the video call so that you will not need to write the answer of the user between one question and the other.
- Build rapport with participants to encourage open and honest responses.
- Transcribe interviews accurately and organise your data systematically. You can use video transcriptors or audio transcriptors available for free online.
- Look for patterns and recurring themes to gain deeper insights into user behaviours and needs.
