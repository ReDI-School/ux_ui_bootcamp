# Milestone 1 - Develop a Research Plan

### What you will do:

Outline your research objectives, methods (user interview), participant recruitment strategy, and timeline. This involves understanding the context of the project, identifying what information is needed, and determining the best methods to gather this information. Furthermore, plan how to recruit participants who fit your target audience criteria and develop a timeline to ensure the research is completed.

### What you learn:

You will develop skills in planning and organizing research activities, which are pivotal for gathering reliable and relevant data. You will learn how to set clear research objectives that align with the project goals, and create a structured approach to participant recruitment. Additionally, you will gain experience in creating a detailed timeline to manage your research process effectively.

### Tips:
- Review the [Foundations Section](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/foundations/introduction-to-ux-design) before you work on the Planning. 
- Clearly define your research objectives to ensure your efforts are focused and relevant.
- As already said and because it’s a practice environment, select the research objective based on the type of user segment you can reach within your network.
- Create a realistic timeline, allowing enough time for each stage of the research process.

### Task 1:
- Define your research objective
- Define what research method you will use (user interviews)
- Create a participant recruitment strategy. Make sure the participant profiles fit your target audience criteria.
- Set up a timeline for the project:
    - When are you going to interview the users?
    - Tip: Look at the Milestone 2 & 3 to see what the next steps are.
