# Introduction
This project will cover essential steps such as crafting a research plan, conducting user interviews, and translating findings into actionable design insights. The project emphasizes the significance of understanding user behaviors and needs, analyzing data, developing detailed user personas, and mapping out user journeys to guide design decisions effectively. 
By systematically approaching these stages, you will gain hands-on experience in shaping a human-centered design strategy that informs and enhances the overall user experience.

# Project Summary
The key element of this project is the number of people you can interview. The more people you reach out to, the more data you can collect and, consequently, the more practical experience you'll gain. 

Interviews, while valuable, can be challenging because they require people to speak openly. As a result, interviews typically last between 30 to 45 minutes, and it's not always guaranteed that you'll get all the information you need.
Therefore, assigning a specific research focus to a particular sector, product, or service would be ineffective if you don't have enough people in your network to interview. Instead, since this is exploratory research, it's essential to consider where the largest concentration of contacts within your network is located.
For example, if you have many friends who are musicians, athletes, travelers, or users of a specific application, focus on these groups. 

If you have a lot of friends who travel frequently, you might explore their experiences related to travel, such as interactions with airports, transportation, or travel-related apps. In summary, choose a research topic that reflects your network and their direct experiences. This approach ensures that your research is grounded in real-world contexts and maximizes the relevance of your findings.

**Tip:** Study all the [Foundations content](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp) before starting the project. You must have cleared the whole picture before initiating the qualitative research. This is because you will be required to create user personas and a user journey map, and the questions you plan to ask will need to be tailored to grant you as much data as possible in order to create these two artifacts.

# Milestones

### 1. Milestone - Develop a Research Plan
Develop a research plan to understand user needs and preferences for the target of your research.

### 2. Milestone - Conduct and Analyse User Interviews
Perform user interviews to gather qualitative insights, then transcribe, code, and analyze the data to uncover key themes and user needs. You should interview at least 3 people and have around 6-10 questions, follow-up excluded, for each person interviewed.

### 3. Milestone - Develop User Personas and Journey Maps
Based on the qualitative data, create detailed user personas that represent your audience. Additionally, craft a user journey map to visualize the user experience, highlighting pain points and opportunities.
