## Milestone 1
### What you will do:
You will learn about the job market and potential careers available. You also understand in which direction you can develop your career moving forward. You learn more about your own profile by carrying out a SWOT analysis and developing your own brand statement.

Once you have a direction (the job profile you aspire to) and are aware of your current profile and capabilities, you will understand what skills and knowledge to develop further and create a professional development roadmap for yourself.

### You will learn more about:

## Task 1: Create Your Professional Development Roadmap on Miro

1. Follow the Loom instructions to set up your workspace:
   - a: Create an account on [Miro](https://miro.com).
   - b: Create a new Miro board.
   - c: [Upload this template] (https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/04_career/Miro%20Template%20for%20Exercise%2010)
   - d: work using the template and the Gitbook resources.
2.  **Create your Professional Development Roadmap on Miro**:
   - Dentify Job Profiles & Requirements, Categorize the Skills Needed: gather and analyze at least 5 job listings for the roles you are interested in. You should look for common requirements and skills listed in these postings.
  - Assess Current Skills Level: The template provided will automatically copy all the skills listed in sheet 1.a to sheet 2. Now that you have an overview of the skills needed, it is time to run a self-assessment on each of the required skills. You can do this in column B for the technical skills and column F for the soft skills.
  - Carry out a SWOT Analysis
  - Set specific goals: Use sheet 3 to organize your action points in a timeline divided into short, medium, and long-term goals.
  - Reflect on your values and create your personal brand statement
