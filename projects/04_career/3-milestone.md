# Milestone 3 -  Application Process

### What you will do:

In Milestone #3 you will complete a case study and participate in a mock tech interview as well as prepare some project from your portfolio for review.

### You will learn more about:
- How to prepare your portfolio for review
- How to work on a case study/take-home exercise
- How to present a case study in a tech interview
- How design interviews are structured
- Receive feedback for your design interview to help you prepare for future interviews!


## Task 1: Portfolio Review

**Objective**: Prepare a brief presentation (10 minutes max in total) of two projects from your portfolio that best showcase your UX/UI design skills, thought process, and impact. During the interview, you will walk the interviewer through these projects, highlighting key aspects of each, including problem-solving, design decisions, and outcomes.


**Goal**: To demonstrate your skills, creativity, and approach to UX/UI design. The interviewer would like to know the following about each piece:
- The context and the story behind the project.
- Your motivation to start the project.
- Main challenges and learnings of the project.

**Resources:** [Your Portfolio](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/4.-project-career/milestone-2-establish-online-presence/portfolio-step-by-step-guide)


## Task 2: Take-Home Task
Complete the following take-home task and share it with your mentor in advance.

#### Take-Home Task: Help job seekers create a glowing resume.

**Task Brief:** Job seekers spend hours designing, editing, and formatting their resumes, and recruiters often struggle to view these resumes on mobile devices. Furthermore, if a job seeker makes a mistake, they typically need to correct it and resend the entire document, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient.

**Challenge:** Design a resume-building tool that helps job seekers effortlessly create and customize standout resumes. The tool should make it easy for recruiters to view these resumes on any device and allow job seekers to quickly update or correct information without resending the entire document.

**Platform:** device. Design for mobile-first (phone screens) and provide responsive layouts for viewing on desktops and tablets.

**Time estimation:** 4-5 hours.

## Task 3: Mock design interview

**Objective:** A mock design interview is a simulation of a job interview used for training purposes. The exercise resembles a real interview as closely as possible to help you understand what is expected in a real job interview and helps you to improve your presentation: practice answering questions, presenting your portfolio, tackling design challenges, and receiving feedback on their performance. The mockup design interviews will last approximately 45-50 minutes and right after the interview, you will have 10 minutes to receive feedback on your performance and suggestions to improve further.

**Goals:**
- Check the mock interview job profile
- Check out the Interview Preparation Repo
- Prepare 2 project from your portfolio to present to the interviewer
- Complete the take-home task and be able to present it in the mock design interview.
- Read about how design interviews are structured to be prepared for the questions that can come up.
