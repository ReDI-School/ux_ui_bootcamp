# 3. Milestone - Usability Test & Case Study

Your proposal is ready to go. At this milestone, you'll validate your proposal with a usability test, get feedback from users, and create documentation of your project to add to your portfolio.

**You will learn more about:** 

- `Usability Testing`
- `Case Study`

**Deliverables:**

- Usability Test
- Documentation

## Task 1 - Run a Usability Test

It is important to validate our proposals, especially for products built from scratch. Plan your unmoderated usability tests to obtain user information that supports the design decisions you have made experimentally.

- Set up your [Usability Test Plan](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/2.-project-mobile-application/milestone-3-prototyping-testing-and-refining/usability-testing). What is your research objective? What is your target user profile? 
- Create a task guide for users in usability tests.
- Run the unmoderated usability test with at least 5 people (guerrilla or potential users).
- Identify error rates and other relevant design metrics in usability tests.
- Summarize your results, showing identified patterns, observations, and findings (if any).

**Deliverables:**

- Usability Test

## Task 2 - Document your Project in a Case Study

You finished your Project. Congratulations! Now it is time to document your project in a case study to include it later on to your portfolio. 
Before jumping into creating your case study, take some time to go through the information we've provided in [Gitbook](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-3-usability-test-and-documentation/design-documentation-and-case-study) that outlines key case study elements and contains additional resources on how to write an outstanding case study with step-by-step guides.

You can follow the example we've used during our class but feel free to tailor the case study to your own taste as it should be unique and showcase your approach and vision of the project:
1. Overview - small summary of the project that provides context.
2. Problem Statement - explain why this project exists, what it's goal or desired outcome.
3. Users and audience - provide the explanation of who is your user.
4. Roles and responsibilities - explain what you did in this project, if you collaborate with others mention their responsibilities and contribution.
5. Scope and constraints - any limitaions that you faced (indicate that it was a technical project without collaboration with a company) or if you have any time, budget, resources limitations.
6. Process - include step-by-step run down of what you did and why you did it:
  - Design concept: Explain the visual design concept and the technical principles underlying the design proposal.
  - Visual elements: Include sketches, diagrams, wireframes, screens, and other visual elements explaining the proposal.
  - Validation results: Present the results of user validation and what you consider still needs iteration.
7. Outcomes and results - What was the result of your work? Did you achieve your goals? What lessons chanve you larnt? What skills have you improved? What still needs improvement (both skills and project deliverables) What are you planning to do in the future for this project?

This documentation will be essential for your presentation at the end of the project. Don't worry about making it perfect: you will keep iterating on it throughout the bootcamp. 

**Deliverables:**

- Case Study in Figma.
