# 2. Milestone - Design & Prototyping

You've got your design proposal ready to go. In this milestone, you'll prototype your proposal by creating a mood board and a high-fidelity prototype.

**You will learn more about:** 

- [Moodboard](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-2-prototyping/mood-board)
- `Component library` built under Atomic Design principles
- `High-fidelity` [prototyping](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-2-prototyping)

## Task 1 - Design

Once you have the structure of your proposal clear, it is time to integrate the visual elements necessary to enhance a good user experience.

**Steps:** 

1. Create a [Moodboard]((https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-2-prototyping/mood-board)) with visual references that work as inspiration for your UI.
2. Create a [Style guide](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-2-prototyping/style-guide) with specifications of the graphic elements: color palette, fonts, layout, and spacing between elements (internal margins: padding / external margins: margin). 

**Deliverables:**

- Moodboard 
- Visual Guide


## Task 2 - Prototyping

Now, it is time to prototype! Use your Style Guide and Mood Board to set up a high-fidelity Prototype that is just enough to test it in the 3rd milestone. 

**Steps:** 

- Create a high-fidelity navigable [prototype](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/2.-project-mobile-application/milestone-3-prototyping-testing-and-refining/prototyping/type-of-prototypes) with basic interactions (change screen, back, etc.). You choose the Layout. You can either create a Prototype for Mobile or for Web. If you create a prototype for mobile, we ask you to create one single screen for web. If you create a prototype for web, we ask you to create one single screen for mobile.
- It must include a web version and a mobile version.
- **OTPIONAL:** Use a [Component library (UI Kit)](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-2-design-and-prototyping/component-library-and-ui-kits) built under [Atomic Design principles](https://medium.com/galaxy-ux-studio/principles-of-atomic-design-7b03a30c3cb6).

**Deliverables:**

- High-fidelity Prototype in the Layout of your Choice (Web or Mobile) and one single screen in the alternative layout (Web or Mobile). The number of screens is not defined. You choose how many screens the prototype needs to be a reasonable test of your hypothesis.
