# 1. Milestone - Planning, Competitor Analysis, Design Proposal

In this milestone, you'll start planning your design project from scratch, then conduct a 
competitor analysis, and finally create the first design proposal! 

**You will learn about:**

- `Competitor Analysis` by identifying key functionalities of the competitors
- `Project Planning` by sketching out your project from start to finish.
- Further advance your `information architecture` skills
- Creating a `Design Proposal`

## Task 1: Planning

**Steps:**

1. Choose a product category from the three proposed areas [Marketing, Sports and Health, Finance](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/03_web_application/README.md)
2.  Write a brief Project Plan outlining the project's overall scope, including potential deliverables. Develop a detailed work plan that lists specific tasks to be completed during the project.
3. Write down which skills you want to strengthen during the project to define the time you will spend in each stage. For example, if you want to strengthen your prototyping and UI design skills, plan a brief analysis and a strong focus on visual exploration from the beginning.

**Deliverable:**

- Project Plan with a detailed work plan. 

## Task 2: Competitor Analysis

After planning your project in the previous task, you now need to understand the users of your product. How to understand the users of a product that doesn't exist yet? By analyzing competitors' products that users use to solve their needs!

**Steps:**

1. Analyse dashboards from competitors. Perform a competitor analysis, where you identify user experience aspects of a functionality of these products. Read about how to conduct a Competitor Analysis in our Gitbook: [Competitor Analysis](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-1-planning-competitor-analysis-design-proposal/competitor-analysis). 
    1. Define your Comparison Criteria: Before you start, create a short list of comparison criteria. You can add more when needed.
    2. Identify Competitors: Who is currently trying to solve this problem? Identify 3-5 competitors. 
    3. Gather Data: Examine competitors’ designs, product interfaces, and features to gather information. Answer: How are the competitors trying to solve the problem? What are their main differentiator or unique value-adds for their business and products? What IA has been chosen? What kind of interactions help to drive the feature? What UI elements complement this goal?
    4. Analyze Design Elements: Evaluate how the competitors’ design choices influence usability, functionality, and user satisfaction. Copy competitor designs into your analysis overview.
    5. Document User Flows: Map out how tasks are completed within competitor apps to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.
    6. Use FigJam to collect, organize, and present your findings. You can also present your findings using Google Slides.

2. Perform a [desk research](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/3.-project-dashboard/milestone-1-planning-competitor-analysis-design-proposal/desk-research) on user pains in the category you have chosen. Add the pain points to your FigJam project file. 

**Deliverables:**

- Competitor Analysis with 3-5 competitors and user pain points. 


## Task 3: Design Proposal

After understanding the users and analyzing competitors' products, you are ready to propose a solution that can be developed within the project timeframe, ensuring that it solves the priority problems.

**Steps:**

- Come up with multiple solution ideas. The ideas can be phrases or pen and paper sketches that represent solutions. Prioritize one.
- Design user flow diagrams and [information architecture](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/2.-project-mobile-application/milestone-2-information-architecture-and-mid-wireframes/information-architecture) (categories, labels, navigation).
- Ensure that the proposal respects usability principles
- Add basic voice and tone guide applied to the digital product.
- Add proposed text, icons and images. You can use ChatGPT for this! Have a look at this [Copy Writer GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-rkKtHhIOR-the-secret-copywriter).
- Create a basic prototype* focusing on the [information architecture](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/2.-project-mobile-application/milestone-2-information-architecture-and-mid-wireframes/information-architecture). 
    *A basic [prototype](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/ux-ui-bootcamp/2.-project-mobile-application/milestone-3-prototyping-testing-and-refining/prototyping/type-of-prototypes) is one that can be navigated between screens and includes the most relevant content and functionalities without including visual details such as color, typography, etc.

**Deliverables:**

- Design Proposal with basic prototype
