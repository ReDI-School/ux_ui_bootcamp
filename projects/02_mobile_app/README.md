## 1. Introduction
Through this project, we aim to explore the nuances of designing a mobile application by focusing on some steps of user experience design—from a touch of qualitative analysis to high-fidelity wireframes. 
This exercise project focuses on analysis, the importance of understanding user goals and needs, translating them into intuitive design solutions, and iteratively refining the product based on user feedback.

## 2. Project Summary
You will be put in the following scenario: Thomas is a young entrepreneur in a hurry to go live as quickly as possible with his meditation mobile app project. He has already conducted market research, competitive analysis, and qualitative research, and he decided to create a meditation app. Unfortunately, your previous colleague left the project without completing the qualitative research, in fact, he didn’t do the qualitative analysis, and now you have to work with what he left and the requirements set by the founder, which are:

1. Splash Screen: A soothing splash screen greeting users, possibly decorated with a relaxing image or a peaceful mantra. Similar to a tranquil introduction, a splash screen establishes the mood as users commence your meditation journey. Investigate existing meditation apps for motivating splash screen models. 
2. Onboarding flow: An engaging onboarding procedure intended to familiarize users with the app’s advantages and offer guidance on initiating use. No more than 3 screens.
3. Sign up - Login: Human-centric sign-up and login features allowing users to enter and securely keep their personal information. 
4. Profile area: A management section providing users access to their profile data and configurations. 
5. Effortless Exploration (specific task of your choice based on data analysis): A way to navigate in an effortless manner through app’s features and content.”
   
This project will be broken down into several phases. Initially, you will focus on data analysis to inform your design decisions. Then, you will create an empathy map, complete a task analysis template placed there to speed up your work, and develop a user flow. 
Following this, you will create mid-fidelity wireframes and a prototype, which will be evaluated through usability testing. The final step will be to refine your design into high-fidelity wireframes.

## 3. Milestones & Deliverables

### 1. Milestone - Develop an Empathy Map, a Task Analysis and User Flows

**What you will do:** You will analyze the answers to the user interviews and extract meaningful insights related to behaviors, attitudes, needs, goals, and frustrations. You will then Identify and highlight key phrases or sentences that indicate user motivations, preferences, and challenges.
You will then create an Empathy Map and fill out a Task Analysis template created to give them a facilitation.
Ultimately you will propose task analysis steps and you will create a user flow.

**What you learn:** You will continue to develop analytical skills and critical thinking by internalizing the fundamental principle of user experience design: that UX Design decisions are rooted in research with the user as the focal point. You will learn to extract and synthesize valuable user insights from interview data, developing a keen eye for identifying and categorizing user behaviors, attitudes, needs, goals, and frustrations. Additionally, you will acquire proficiency in creating empathy maps to visualize and deepen your understanding of user experiences. Furthermore, You will become familiar with the principles of task analysis, utilizing it to comprehend user flows and goals, while also gaining an understanding of user flows themselves, essential components in crafting seamless user experiences.

**Tips:**

- Keep your notes and highlights well-organised to easily reference key insights when creating the empathy map and task analysis.
- Consider user context, challenges, and goals to ensure your analysis accurately reflects your experiences.
- Don’t hesitate to revisit and refine your empathy map and task analysis as you gain more insights. Iteration helps in developing a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the users.
- UX Designers do not work alone. If possible, collaborate with peers to get feedback on your work. Different perspectives can help identify gaps or new insights.

**Deliverables:**

1. Analysis, Empathy Map
2. Task Analysis & User Flows _(including Splash Screen, Onboarding, Sign-up/Login, Exploration (specific task of your choice based on data analysis))_

### 2. Milestone - Create an Information Architecture and Mid-Wireframes

**What you do:** You will begin by reviewing your previously developed user flow to ensure the user goals are clear. You will then analyze competitors like Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer to understand industry standards. Using tools such as pencil and paper, FigJam, Figma, or Miro, you will create a Site Map by conducting a content audit, grouping related content, arranging these groups hierarchically, and mapping out links between sections. 
Optionally, you can conduct a card sorting exercise using a tool like Optimal Workshop to gather user insights. For wireframes, you will sketch key screens on paper, annotate these sketches with design decisions, and then create mid-fidelity wireframes in Figma. 
The screens will include the splash screen, onboarding screens, sign-up/login page, profile area, and user flow reflecting a key user goal. Finally, you will share your wireframes for feedback and make necessary adjustments.

**What you learn:** Through this process, you will learn the importance of Information Architecture in enhancing user experience and the different types of IA structures such as hierarchical, sequential, and flat structures. 
You will gain practical skills in conducting organising information, and creating Site Maps. Additionally, you will understand the differences between low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity wireframes, and how to focus on user experience elements like navigation, content organisation, and interaction flow. 
By using Figma to create wireframes, you will develop practical design skills, and by conducting card sorting (optional), You will gain insights into user preferences to create more intuitive designs.

**Tips:**
- Ensure you have gained the elements of Information Architecture (IA) and the importance of clear navigation in digital products. Understanding these concepts will provide a strong framework for your work.
- When creating a site map, focus on clarity and logical organization.
- UX Designers do not work alone. If possible, collaborate with peers to get feedback on your work. Different perspectives can help identify gaps or new insights.

**Deliverables:**

- Site Map in Figjam 
- Mid-Fidelity Wireframes _(Wireframes for the screens and flows specified in Milestone 1)_

### 3. Milestone - Prototyping, Testing and Refining
**What you do:** You will first convert your mid-fidelity wireframes into clickable prototypes using Figma, following the user flows previously established. You can refer to Figma tutorials for assistance in prototyping. 
Next, you will engage in usability testing and refinement. You will decide on tasks to test, prepare test plans and scripts, and conduct three rounds of usability tests with different users, focusing on tasks related to online meditation. During the tests, you will take notes and prepare a Usability Analysis Report using Nielsen error metrics. 
After completing the tests, you will refine your mid-fidelity wireframes based on your findings and then create high-fidelity wireframes, incorporating elements like splash screens, onboarding flows, sign-up/login screens, profile areas, and features tested during usability analysis.

**What you learn:** You will learn how to translate mid-fidelity wireframes into interactive prototypes using Figma, gaining proficiency in simulating user interactions and flows. Through usability testing, you will learn how to develop test plans, scripts, and conduct sessions to gather valuable feedback from users. You will also gain insights into analyzing usability data and prioritizing design improvements based on user feedback.
