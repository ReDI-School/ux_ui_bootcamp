# 1. Milestone - Develop an Empathy Map, a Task Analysis and User Flows

### What you will do:

You will analyse the answer of the user interviews and extract meaningful insights related to behaviours, attitudes, needs, goals, and frustrations. You will then Identify and highlight key phrases or sentences that indicate user motivations, preferences, and challenges You will then create an Empathy Map and fill out a Task Analysis template created to give them a facilitation. Ultimately you will propose task analysis steps and you will create a user flow.

### You will learn more about:

You will continue to develop analytical skills and critical thinking by internalizing the fundamental principle of user experience design: that UX Design decisions are rooted in research with the user as the focal point. You will learn to extract and synthesize valuable user insights from interview data, developing a keen eye for identifying and categorizing user behaviors, attitudes, needs, goals, and frustrations. Additionally, you will acquire proficiency in creating empathy maps to visualize and deepen your understanding of user experiences. Furthermore, you will become familiar with the principles of task analysis, utilizing it to comprehend user flows and goals, while also gaining an understanding of user flows themselves, essential components in crafting seamless user experiences.

### Tips:

- Keep your notes and highlights well-organised to easily reference key insights when creating the empathy map and task analysis.
- Consider user context, challenges, and goals to ensure your analysis accurately reflects their experiences.
- Don’t hesitate to revisit and refine your empathy map and task analysis as you gain more insights. Iteration helps in developing a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the users.
- UX Designers do not work alone. If possible, collaborate with peers to get feedback on your work. Different perspectives can help identify gaps or new insights.

### Deliverables:

1. Empathy Map
2. Task Analysis & User Flows


### Task 1 - Empathy Map

1. Go through the interview answers and extract informations that reflect:
  - **Behaviours and Attitudes:** Pay attention to behaviours and attitudes that align with your research objectives.
  - **Needs or Goals:** Identify any needs or goals your participants express. For instance, a user might say,
  - **Frustrations:** Document any frustrations participants voice. These frustrations can help you refine your project and improve user satisfaction.

To document your findings you can highlight the important parts as you did in the Projcet 1 for Thematic Analysis or copy/paste on another document what you consider meaningful to determine the needs and goals or eventual paint points to leverage.

2. Sort out your data by answering the 7 questions of the Empathy Map canvas.
Feel free to copy and use [this Figjam template](https://www.figma.com/board/buN7DHI677hs1KGe8tJukt/Empathy-Map-Example?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=P3xVB6aVpdCIQrvw-0). You can also just write the questions on paper/google sheet or recreate the canvas template in Miro or Figma.

Keep in mind that this is an exercise with dummy content for you to practise, so if your data analysis does not allow you to answer all the questions, it’s totally fine.

3. At the end of this deliverable, you should have clear what are the behaviour/attitudes, needs or goals and frustrations or paint points but, you may also be able to uncover emotions.

### Task 2 - Fill out the Task Analysis Template and create the User Flows

**1. Go through the below template, it’s a sort of Task Analysis synthesis, and fill it up, the data can all be retrieved from the [dummy user interviews answers](https://github.com/ReDI-School/ux_ui_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/02_mobile_app/interviews.md):**

Now, even if we didn’t conduct a “Task Analysis” and the only research method of it we had, were these interviews that Thomas our beloved founder gave to you, we can do a bit of reverse engineering and try to propose the task analysis steps that would have emerged through a complete “Task Analysis”.

In the following template, you already have the main name of some of the tasks individuated through the interviews, try to fill up the template, you have the data, are all available in the user interview answers

**2. Template - Proposed Task Analysis Steps**

Task 1: Starting a Meditation Practice\

Step 2..\

Task 2: Incorporating Meditation into Daily Routine\
Step 1…\
Step 2…\
Step 3…\

Task 3: Using Meditation Apps\
Step 1…\

Task 4: Engaging with Guided Meditation\

Task 5: Maintaining a Regular Meditation Practice\

Bear in mind that both templates are just templates, you may be able to spot something extra, go for it, in case your teacher will evaluate it.

Based on the information that you have extracted so far, you should have a better view of who these people are, and why they use a meditation app.

**3. Create the User Flow**

We are now in the “Effortless Navigation” requirement and it’s time to create the “User Flow”

Suggestions:
- Take a look at the app meditations of the competitors that the users interviewed mentioned, navigate them and see how your user flow is organised.
- As an entry point for your “User Flow” you can use the splash screen, or skip it and use the sign up/login as entry point.
- What comes after the entry point, is the path that the user needs to take in order to achieve its goal, the task that he has to perform which is made of several steps. It can be a straight happy path or a more elaborate path if, for example, you want to include more than one goal (registration, changing meditation, adding meditation and so on.
If you opt for a “User Flow” that displays different paths and so different tasks, remember that when you will have to create the wireframes out of it, specifically for the prototyping stage, you may open to break it down so as to have separate tasks.
- To create your “User Flows” you can choose between Figma, FigmaJam or Miro or well, even paper and pencil if you have no other means.
